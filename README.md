# Transfer-Learning-based-QOT-Estimation-of-an-Unestablished-Lightpath
In this research we have explored Transfer Learning and how we can use it for QOT Estimation of an Unestablished Lightpath. This research aims to provide idea that how we can use models trained on bigger datasets and with complex architecture to get accurate results on our small datasets.
